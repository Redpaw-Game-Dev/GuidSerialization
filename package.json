  "description": "A package with a globally unique identifier (GUID) that can be serialized with Unity and used in game scripts. I am NOT the author of the original idea or script. I just extended the functionality and extracted it as a separate package. I would like to thank Adam Myhre, aka Git Amend, for creating the script.
